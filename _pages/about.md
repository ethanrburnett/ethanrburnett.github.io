# Bio notes: 
# There I also completed an M.S. degree under Prof. Eric Butcher, an expert in dynamics and control of nonlinear, time-periodic, and time-delayed systems. 
# Currently I'm focused on the development of convex optimization-based techniques for speedy spacecraft onboard guidance. In my work I'm leveraging ideas that the solution to a dynamical system evolves as a projection (or in the controlled case, a sequence or evolution of projections) of an infinite sum of fundamental solutions. By this framework we can trade nonlinearities in problem dynamics and constraints for a constructed nonlinearity of known structure of our own design, reducing the solve time and increasing robustness for challenging tasks in nonlinear guidance.

I am a spaceflight engineer and space scientist. Originally from Arizona, I studied Aerospace Engineering and Physics at the University of Arizona. 
I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from the Aerospace Engineering Sciences department at the University of Colorado Boulder. Working in the [AVS Lab](https://hanspeterschaub.info/main.html) led by Prof. Hanspeter Schaub, my focus was on the guidance, control, and dynamics of spacecraft relative motion. This is a critical topic for spacecraft formation flying and rendezvous. Afterwards I worked as a guidance engineer at Blue Origin in Seattle, WA.

Presently I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow working in the [DART Group](https://dart.polimi.it) led by Prof. Francesco Topputo at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.aero.polimi.it/en). My project, [FAAST](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101063274), is focused on reliable onboard guidance for autonomous spacecraft. For this work I've leveraged ideas from differential algebra and geometric mechanics to develop a speedy and robust sequential convex optimization scheme. The work has been applied to spacecraft rendezvous guidance subject to nonlinear dynamics and constraints.

I am also a planetary scientist, having written or contributed to a few articles in Icarus and the Planetary Science Journal, mostly in collaboration with Prof. Paul Hayne, [CU Boulder LASP](https://lasp.colorado.edu/people/paul-hayne/). My interests are in the geological and dynamical evolution of the icy ocean worlds orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, and, more broadly, the modernization of tidal theory for realistic rheologies. Recently I've been studying tidal dissipation and rotational/orbital evolution in rubble pile binary asteroid systems, using the Polimi-developed N-body numerical simulator GRAINS as an experimental domain.
