	abstract = {This paper introduces a framework by which the nonlinear trajectory optimization problem is posed as a path-planning problem in a space liberated of dynamics. In this space, general state constraints for continuous and impulsive control problems are encoded as linear constraints on the native overparameterized variables. This framework is enabled by nonlinear expansion in the vicinity of a reference in terms of fundamental solutions and a minimal nonlinear basis of mixed monomials in problem initial conditions. The former can be computed using state transition tensors, differential algebra, or analytic approaches, and the latter is computed analytically. Nonlinear guidance schemes are proposed taking advantage of this framework, including a successive convex programming scheme for delta-V minimizing trajectory optimization. This work enables a stable, easy to implement, and highly rapid nonlinear guidance implementation without the need for collocation or real-time integration.},

@article{Burnett:2020aa,
	abstract = {This paper explores an alternative interpolation approach for the line-of-sight measurements in Laplace's method for angles-only initial orbit determination (IOD). The classical implementation of the method uses Lagrange polynomials to interpolate three or more unit line-of-sight (LOS) vectors from a ground-based or orbiting site to an orbiting target. However, such an approach does not guarantee unit magnitude of the interpolated line-of-sight path except at the measurement points. The violation of this constraint leads to unphysical behavior in the derivatives of the interpolated line-of-sight history, which can lead to poor initial orbit determination (IOD) performance. By adapting a spherical interpolation method used in the field of computer graphics, we can obtain an interpolated line-of-sight history that is always unit norm. This new spherical interpolation method often leads to significant performance improvements in Laplace's IOD method, with comparable robustness to measurement noise as the traditional interpolation methods. This paper also demonstrates the benefit of interpolating through more than three data points, which is easily enabled up to an arbitrary number of measurements by recursive definitions of the interpolations.},

	abstract = {This paper explores methods for approximating and analyzing the dynamics of highly perturbed spacecraft formations with an emphasis on computationally efficient approaches. This facilitates on-board computation or rapid preliminary mission design analysis. Perturbed formation dynamics are often approximated as linear time-varying (LTV) systems, for which Floquet theory can be used to analyze the degree of system instability. Furthermore, the angular momentum of the relative orbital state can be computed with the approximate dynamics to provide additional insight. A general methodology is developed first and then applied to the problem of unstable formation dynamics in asteroid orbits. Here the dominant perturbative effects due to low-order gravitational harmonics and solar radiation pressure are modeled. Numerical simulations validate the approach and illustrate the approximation accuracy achieved.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a linear model for spacecraft formation dynamics subject to attitude-dependent solar radiation pressure (SRP) disturbance, with the SRP model accounting for both absorption and specular/diffuse reflection. Spacecraft attitude is represented in modified Rodriguez parameters (MRPs), which also parameterize the orientation of individual facets for a spacecraft with fixed geometry. Compared to earlier work, this model incorporates analytic approximation of the SRP-perturbed chief orbit behavior in a manner enabling its use in applications with infrequent guidance updates. Control examples are shown for single-plate representations of hypothetical spacecraft with generally realistic optical parameters. The results demonstrate the validity of the model and the feasibility of SRP-based formation and rendezvous control in orbits around small bodies and in high orbits around the Earth such as the GEO belt.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the problem of analytically approximating the orbital state for a subset of orbits in a rotating potential with oblateness and ellipticity perturbations. This is done by isolating approximate differential equations for the orbit radius and other elements. The conservation of the Jacobi integral is used to make the problem solvable to first order in the perturbations. The solutions are characterized as small deviations from an unperturbed circular orbit. The approximations are developed for near-circular orbits with initial mean motion n0 around a body with rotation rate c. The approximations are shown to be valid for values of angular rate ratio Gamma = c/n0 > 1, with accuracy decreasing as Gamma approaches 1, and singularities at and near Gamma = 1. Extensions of the methodology to eccentric orbits are discussed, with commentary on the challenges of obtaining generally valid solutions for both near-circular and eccentric orbits.},

	abstract = {The Saturnian moon Enceladus presents a unique opportunity to sample the contents of a subsurface liquid water ocean in situ via the continuous plume formed over its south polar terrain using a multi-flyby mission architecture. Previous analyses of the plume's composition by Cassini revealed an energy-rich system laden with salts and organic compounds, representing an environment containing most of the ingredients for life as we know it. Following in the footsteps of the Cassini-Huygens mission, we present Astrobiology eXploration at Enceladus (AXE), a New Frontiers class Enceladus mission concept study carried out during the 2021 NASA Planetary Science Summer School program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. We demonstrate that a scientifically compelling geophysical and life-detection mission to Enceladus can be carried out within the constraints of a New Frontiers-5 cost cap using a modest instrument suite, requiring only a narrow angle, high-resolution telescopic imager, a mass spectrometer, and a high-gain antenna for radio communications and gravity science measurements. Using a multi-flyby mission architecture, AXE would evaluate the habitability and potential for life at Enceladus through a synergistic combination of in situ chemical analysis measurements aimed at directly detecting the presence of molecular biosignatures, along with geophysical and geomorphological investigations to contextualize chemical biosignatures and further evaluate the habitability of Enceladus over geologic time.},

@article{Burnett_Icarus2,
	abstract = {Europa is an icy ocean world, differentiated into a floating ice shell and solid interior, separated by a global ocean. The classical spin--orbit coupling problem considers a satellite as a single rigid body, but in the case of Europa, the existence of the subsurface ocean enables independent motion of the ice shell and solid interior. This paper explores the spin--orbit coupling problem for Europa from a dynamical perspective, yielding illuminating analytical and numerical results. We determine that the spin behavior of Europa is influenced by processes not captured by the classical single rigid body spin--orbit coupling analysis. The tidal locking process for Europa is governed by the strength of gravity-gradient coupling between the ice shell and solid interior, with qualitatively different behavior depending on the scale of this effect. In this coupled rigid model, the shell can potentially undergo large angular displacements from the solid interior, and the coupling plays an outsize role in the dynamical evolution of the moon, even without incorporating the dissipative effects of shell non-rigidity. We additionally discuss the effects of a realistic viscoelastic shell, and catalogue other torques that we expect to be sub-dominant in Europa's spin dynamics, or whose importance is unknown. Finally, we explore how the choice of tidal model affects the resulting equilibrium spin state.},

@article{Burnett_Icarus1,
	abstract = {Europa's surface reflectance exhibits a pronounced hemispheric dichotomy, which is hypothesized to form due to enhanced irradiation of the trailing hemisphere by energetic particles entrained in the jovian magnetosphere. We propose that this pattern can only persist if the timescale for discoloration is much shorter than that of Europa's rotation relative to the synchronous state, and provide a means for constraining the rotation rate using the observed color pattern. By decomposing the longitudinal ultraviolet and visible color variations from Voyager data into sine and cosine terms, we find no detectable signature of non-synchronous rotation (NSR). This same conclusion is reached with two observational models of discoloration: one representing an actively discoloring surface, and the other assuming that the present-day exogenic discoloration on the surface is in steady-state. Magnitudes of the expected signature are presented as functions of the age of the crater Pwyll, which is used to constrain the timescale of discoloration. Furthermore, we develop a physical model of discoloration to validate the geometric models, producing consistent results. The failure to identify a signature of NSR using Europa's hemispheric color dichotomy magnifies the outstanding problem of the origin of the stress to explain Europa's pervasive tectonic features.},

	abstract = {Aerocapture is a method of achieving orbit insertion via a single pass through the atmosphere of the central body. Single-event jettison drag modulation is a simple way of achieving control during atmospheric flight by effecting a discrete change in the aerodynamics of the vehicle. A novel guidance algorithm, energy reference guidance, is developed and implemented for a reference scenario of a small satellite aerocapture demonstration at Earth, and is compared to the baseline numerical predictor--corrector solution. The new approach is shown to achieve equivalent apoapsis targeting performance as the baseline algorithm with significantly lower CPU demand during atmospheric flight, although more onboard memory is required in exchange. The relationship between targeting performance and required memory is quantitatively explored for the new algorithm; the selected configuration generates approximately 3.3 MB of data, which is expected to be well within the capability of relevant avionics systems.},

	abstract = { This paper explores expressing the relative state in the close-proximity satellite relative motion problem in terms of fundamental modal solution constants. The nominal uncontrolled relative state can be expressed in terms of a weighted sum of fundamental and geometrically insightful modal motions. These fundamental motions are obtained using the Lyapunov--Floquet theory. In the case that the dynamics are perturbed by the action of a controller or by unmodeled dynamics, the weights on each fundamental solution are allowed to vary as in a variation-of-parameters approach, and in this manner function as state variables. This methodology reveals interesting insights about satellite relative motion and enables elegant control approaches. This approach can be applied in any dynamical environment as long as the chief orbit is periodic, and this is demonstrated with results for relative motion analysis and control in the eccentric Keplerian problem and in the circular restricted three-body problem. Some commentary on the extension of the methodology beyond the periodic chief orbit case is also provided. This is a promising and widely applicable new approach to the close-proximity satellite relative motion problem. },
