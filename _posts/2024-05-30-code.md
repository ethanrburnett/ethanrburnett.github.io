I'm just modifying slightly one of the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) post example posts for this.

First, here's some example math using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.


This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 \* bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

````markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
````

Which displays:

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}
